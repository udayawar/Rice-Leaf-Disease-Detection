## 🧠🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This project is a deep learning–based web application that detects diseases in rice plant leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model analyzes uploaded leaf images and predicts whether the leaf is healthy or diseased, helping farmers and agricultural researchers identify plant health issues early.

## 🚀 Features

Upload a rice leaf image

Predict disease using a trained CNN model

Simple and interactive Streamlit web interface

Fast and accurate results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Streamlit

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/udayawar/Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
cd Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run app.py


Open the link shown in terminal (usually):

http://localhost:8501

## 📷 How It Works

Upload a rice leaf image

The CNN model processes the image

The model predicts the disease class

The result is displayed on the web interface

## 🎯 Use Cases

Farmers for early disease detection

Agricultural researchers

Smart farming systems

AI in agriculture projects
